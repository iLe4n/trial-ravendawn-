Q2 -  Fix or improve the implementation of the below method
---------------------------------------------------

function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
    -- This function should print the names of all guilds that have fewer than memberCount as the maximum number of members
    
    -- SQL query to select the names of guilds with fewer than memberCount as the maximum number of members
    local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < " .. memberCount .. ";"
    
    -- Execute the query on the database
    local resultId = db.storeQuery(selectGuildQuery)
    
    -- Check if the query returned any result
    if resultId then
        -- Iterate over the results and print the names of the guilds
        repeat
            local row = result.fetchRow(resultId)
            if row then
                local guildName = row["name"]
                print(guildName)
            end
        until not row
        result.free(resultId) -- Free the result after using it
    else
        print("No guild found with fewer than " .. memberCount .. " members.")
    end
end

---------------------------------------------------
I used string.format directly in the SQL query string to organize and inject the memberCount variable correctly.
After that, I added error handling to check if the query was executed successfully and if any guilds were found.
Then, I used Result.getString and Result.Next to fetch the names of the guilds from the result set that is given to me.
And after that, I leave the result set free using result.free.
