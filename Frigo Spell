------Frigo Spell------

To create this spell, I was able to use an old program called SpellCreator, but it wasn't working as I wanted, so I made the changes directly in the client's code. I took the spell in question, which was "exevo gran mas frigo," took its sprite, and added the spell I wanted to repeat as shown in the Discord video. In the video, I can make it however I want, from size, quantity, and even duration (as shown in the video).
The alteration was simple, I just had to take the spell in question and change how I wanted it to work in my client. In the Lua code, I can add it to the combat " setArea(createCombatArea() " and add the size or how I want my spell to come out. Our change in Data/Lib/Spells. 

I used, as you'll see in the video:
local combat = Combat()
combat:setParameter(COMBAT_PARAM_TYPE, COMBAT_ICEDAMAGE)
combat:setParameter(COMBAT_PARAM_EFFECT, CONST_ME_ICETORNADO)
combat:setArea(createCombatArea({
{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
{0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
{0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
{0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
{0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0},
{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
{0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0},
{0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
{0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
{0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
}))

function onGetFormulaValues(player, level, maglevel)
	local min = (level / 5) + (maglevel * 5.5) + 25
	local max = (level / 5) + (maglevel * 11) + 50
	return -min, -max
end

combat:setCallback(CALLBACK_PARAM_LEVELMAGICVALUE, "onGetFormulaValues")

function onCastSpell(creature, variant)
	return combat:execute(creature, variant)
end

Our, change setArea(createCombatArea() for combat:setArea(createCombatArea(AREA_CIRCLE2X2)), combat:setArea(createCombatArea(AREA_WAVE4)). 
Sure, here's the translation of your text into English:
Is it easy to modify.
After doing that, I simply entered the XML source and looked for the spell I wanted to change. There, I can change everything, time, whether it's something for premium players or not, to which vocations, the name of the spell, and other changes
Indeed, the other spells are edited and configured in the same way, meaning the standard creation and editing process of spells remains unchanged in this regard.
