------Q3 - Fix or improve the name and the implementation of the below method--------


function do_sth_with_PlayerParty(playerId, membername)
    local player = Player(playerId)
    local party = player:getParty()

    if party == nil then
        player:sendTextMessage(MESSAGE_STATUS_CONSOLE_ORANGE, "You are not in a party.")
        return
    end

    local members = party:getMembers()
    local found = false

    for _, member in ipairs(members) do 
        if member:getName() == membername then 
            party:removeMember(member)
            found = true
            break
        end
    end

    if found then
        player:sendTextMessage(MESSAGE_STATUS_CONSOLE_BLUE, membername .. " has been removed from the party.")
    else
        player:sendTextMessage(MESSAGE_STATUS_CONSOLE_ORANGE, membername .. " is not in your party.")
    end
end
-------------
Firstly, the code checks whether the player is in a party or not before manipulating this data. This avoids any bugs if the player is already in a party.
Secondly, I corrected the loop to check the member's name in the party using "member:getName()" and used ipairs to iterate over the party members in order.
Afterwards, I added a small message if the player/member has been successfully removed from the party or if they have not been found for it.
